* Misses easy, human-readable YAML automation tasks.
* Lacks consistent configuration across environments.
* Loses the simplicity of agentless architecture.
* Struggles with scaling operations efficiently.
* Lacks idempotent tasks, causing redundant operations.
* Misses access to numerous built-in management modules.
* Loses seamless integration with cloud providers and CI/CD tools.
